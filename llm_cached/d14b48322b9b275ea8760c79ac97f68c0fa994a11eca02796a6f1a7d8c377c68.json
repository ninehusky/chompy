  "prompt": "\nYou are generating new terms in a small programming language.\nThe syntax is s-expressions with the following operators:\n- !=: arity 2\n- <=: arity 2\n- <: arity 2\n- ==: arity 2\n\n\nYou will be given a list of existing terms.\nYour task is to propose additional terms that are:\n- significantly different from the input set,\n- likely to be useful in rewrite rules (e.g., distributivity, commutativity, associativity, idempotence),\n- non-trivial (avoid constant-only terms unless they reduce to a single constant),\n- and include variables in most cases.\n\nOutput requirements:\n- Generate about {term_limit} additional terms.\n- Produce a variety of sizes and shapes (not just shallow terms, include large terms as well).\n- Ensure all terms are distinct and not repeats of the input.\n- Output **only the terms**, one per line.\n- Do not include any commentary, numbering, or explanations.\n- Do not introduce any new variables outside the set given.\n- Do not include any markdown backticks.\n\nExample Input Terms:\nx\ny\n0\n1\n(+ x y)\n(abs x)\n\nExample Output:\n(+ (* x y) (* x z))\n(* (+ x y) z)\n(max (abs y) x)\n(min x (+ y 1))\n(- (* x 0) y)\n\nInput Terms:\na\nb\nc\n(max a b )\n(max a c )\n(max b c )\n(min c c )\n(/ c b )\n(max (min c c ) c )\n(max (/ a a ) a )\n(/ (max a a ) c )\n(max (/ b b ) a )\n(/ b (max a b ) )\n(/ (min a (min a a ) ) b )\n(/ (max c c ) (max c c ) )\n(max (min a b ) (min b b ) )\n(min a (max c (/ a b ) ) )\n(min (max a a ) (min b a ) )\n",
